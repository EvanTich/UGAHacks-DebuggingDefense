# UGAHacks - Debugging Defense

## Inspiration
Games are fun, debugging is not. Here's a game about squashing virtual bugs.

## What it does
It's a tower defense game, where you squash bugs and buy parts for your computer.

## How we built it
We used Java with JavaFX along side our favorite photo editing software, GIMP.

## Challenges we ran into
GIMP sucks with opacity. We used [paint.net](www.getpaint.net) too.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to actually finish an application in 36 hours.

## What we learned
Rubber ducks are good for debugging, so we added one to Frank's desk. It's not necessarily about the product at the end, but the experience we've had.

## What's next for Debugging Defense
New levels, new characters (where's Frank?!?), did the rubber ducky come back, where are all these bugs coming from, and even more when we actual finish the game! Thanks for playing!
